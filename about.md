Hey there! I am Nikhita Raghunath and I dabble in distributed systems and open source.

I am a core contributor to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
Previously, I was an intern at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) and worked on the extensibility of the Kubernetes API.
I was also a Google Summer of Code (2017) student for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and worked on Kubernetes. You can know more about my GSoC work [here](https://github.com/nikhita/gsoc-meta-k8s).
Now, I volunteer as a [GSoC Organization Admin](https://github.com/cncf/soc#organization-admins) for CNCF and help run the program for them.

You can find me at these places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email. Please note that due to the large influx of email, it might take 2-3 business days for me to reply back.
